<h1>TableDataProviderConfig</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Common front end application usually has 3 different model types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Data transfer models - objects what used to pass / received data form / to server. These models is not
        controlled by front end application and should be mapped to application domain model as soon these data recieved
        from http request.
    </li>
    <li>Application domain models - objects used to represent data inside the application.</li>
    <li>Component models - interfaces used by UI components in order to represent data inside them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The data transfer models must be separated from application domain models since in case of any breaking changes on
    backend API we could jsut change mappings from dto to application models and no changes will be propagated to the
    rest of the application.
</p>

<p>
    The application models must be separated from component models since we want to manipulate data inside the
    application in most convenient way and also we don't always control UI component models. For example we would have
    our data for lists normalized inside the application and then display them in UI list component as denormalized one.

<pre>
    <code hlc-code-highlight="ts">
        {{interface_definition}}
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    As suggested above we should always convert dto models to application models as soon as we get them from http
    requests, so dto models is no concerns further application implementation.
</p>

<p>
    The TableDataProviderConfig provides a configurable way to convert application models to <a>hlc-clr-table</a> and
    <a>hlc-clr-list</a> UI component models.
</p>

<h2 id="map_state">mapState</h2>

<code hlc-code-highlight="ts"> {{ map_state_definition }} </code>

<p>
    Provides mapper which should convert current list / table "state" which contains all properties required to request
    relevant data for active UI component state such as sort column, filters, pagination to the application model
    structure which used to request data from the server, this application model then could be converted to the request
    dto model.
</p>

<h3>state argument</h3>

Since underlying table / list implementation use clarity data grid this argument has
<a href="https://clarity.design/documentation/datagrid/server-driven" target="_blank">ClrDatagridStateInterface</a> type
which fully describes list / table state model containing such parameters as sort column, filters and pagination.

<h3>return value</h3>

The appllication model used to describe list requests inside the application.

<h2 id="map_result">mapResult</h2>

<code hlc-code-highlight="ts"> {{ map_result_definition }} </code>

<p>
    Provides mapper which should convert result from request (this result already has application model format) to the
    list / table UI component model format.
</p>

<h3>result argument</h3>

<p>This is result in application domain model format specific for the application.</p>

<h3>result value</h3>

<p>The converted result value must have component model Table.Data.Result type</p>

<pre>
    <code hlc-code-highlight="ts"> {{ table_data_result_definition }} </code>
</pre>

<p>
    List / table components will render UI based on the data from this structure.
</p>
